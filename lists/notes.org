* Broken
** Support more than one list
** Adjust model so that items are associated with different lists 
**  Add unique URLs for each list 
** Add a URL for creating a new list via POST 
** Add URLs for adding a new item to an existing list via POST

* FIXED
** lists/views.py stores empty item to db on every page visit
** Code smell: POST test is too long?
** remove time.sleeps
** Clean up after functional tests run
** Display multiple items in the table
